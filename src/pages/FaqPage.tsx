const questions = [
  ['What is KinkAtlas?', 'KinkAtlas is a private self-reflection tool that suggests role vocabulary from patterns in your answers. It does not decide your identity.'],
  ['How does KinkAtlas work?', 'It uses deterministic, rules-based assessment with reviewed question-to-theme mappings and role evidence rules.'],
  ['Does KinkAtlas use AI to generate my results?', 'Generative AI does not analyze your answers or generate your results.'],
  ['Are my answers stored?', 'Assessment answers and results are not persisted by KinkAtlas. They remain in browser memory for the current session; refreshing or closing clears that session.'],
  ['Why might I get fewer than five suggested roles?', 'Suggestions require enough relevant evidence. Fewer than five suggestions—or zero suggestions—is valid; KinkAtlas does not fill the set with weak matches.'],
  ['What do Alignment and Confidence mean?', 'Alignment is how closely your answers resemble a role’s themes. Confidence is how much relevant information was available. Confidence does not determine ranking.'],
  ['What does Evidence breadth mean?', 'Evidence breadth is how much of a role’s relevant theme set had usable answer evidence; it is not match strength.'],
  ['Do boundaries affect my role results?', 'No. Hard limits and boundaries do not lower role alignment or change role ranking. They guide activity suggestions independently.'],
  ['Does a suggested role mean I should identify with it?', 'No. Role suggestions are vocabulary suggestions, not identity assignments. Keep, question, combine, or decline any label.'],
  ['Does a role imply consent?', 'No. A role does not imply consent. Consent is specific, informed, voluntary, ongoing, and withdrawable.'],
  ['Can I add roles manually?', 'Yes. You can add, remove, reorder, and choose a primary role in your role set. Manual selections do not gain assessment scores or confidence.'],
  ['Can I leave my role set empty?', 'Yes. Leaving the role set empty is valid.'],
  ['What is Reflection?', 'Reflection is a separate look at knowledge and attitudes expressed in scenario answers. It is not role alignment, a readiness guarantee, or a safety assessment.'],
  ['What are Potential blind spots?', 'They are answer-based reflection signals shown with severity and context. They are prompts to review, not judgments about your behavior.'],
  ['Are these results a safety assessment?', 'No. KinkAtlas does not certify safety, predict behavior, or replace education, communication, or consent negotiation.'],
  ['Why can two people use the same role label differently?', 'Role vocabulary varies across people, communities, and contexts. KinkAtlas descriptions are starting points; ask what a label means to the person using it.'],

            <summary>Will my answers be saved?</summary>
            <p>No. Answers live only in browser memory. Reloading or closing this tab erases them. The app has no account, database, tracking pixel, or answer-storage API.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can this tell me which role I am?</summary>
            <p>No. It suggests vocabulary that may be useful. Identity remains yours to choose, change, combine, or decline.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Does a strong readiness result mean someone is safe?</summary>
            <p>No. It reflects answers to limited scenarios, not real-world conduct. It cannot certify anyone as a safe partner.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>What happens to a hard limit?</summary>
            <p>It stays independent of role alignment. It puts the related activity off the table, not the role. A limit is never scored as a weakness or treated as something to overcome.</p>
